		<strong>About Me:</strong>
		<p>Hello! my name is Robert Emicente i am a senior here at Baruch College. I have no idea what im going
		   to do after graduation, as i spent most of my time working to pay for college and expenses. So i guess
		   it is time to start looking for internships and apply to as many as possible. Over the summer i took
		   CIS4800, and after my class finished i went to Mexico before Fall 2025 began. Im currently looking forward
		   to graduation, and maybe pursue a Masters Degree or simply take a break from school and join the field.
		   I graduated BMCC with an AAS in Computer Information Systems.</p>

		<strong> Course Expectations:</strong>
		<p>After the first class, i really don't know what to expect. I left asking myself very deep philosophical
		   questions and it really isn't something i was expecting from a Web Engineering Class. Overall, i look forward to 
		   learning as much as i can and to gain valuable experience and knowledge to apply it in an internship 
		   position.</p>

		<strong> Interest:</strong>
		<p> I enjoyed my time working in Database Administration classes, specificaly using SQL. I find data interesting.
			the way SQL was able to filter and view large amounts of Data for visualization was an interesting experience,
			hence, that is a place where i would like to start my career, working with SQL and Data. In the future
			(hopefully near future) i see myself teaching, i would like to return to BMCC, because i really enjoyed my
			Community College experience... And why not, Baruch too!</p>
